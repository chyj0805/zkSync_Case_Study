# **zkSync Case Study**

## **Overview and Origin**
Zksync is a layer 2 protocal that scales Ethereum's security and values through zero-knowledge cryptography powered by zkRollup technology, this project founded by Matter Labs intially strated at June in 2020 with this first product zkSync 1.0. From lastest series C round brings the total funding of 458 million. This includes a separate $200 million dedicated ecosystem fund, $50 million Series B led by a16z (crypto venture capital fund), and $8 million in Series A and Seed round. 

Over the past couple years, the biggest pain point with Ethereum transaction has been gas fee. Those gas fees are not variable, if you try to send $2 worth of Ethereum or $1millions, you will be pay the same amount in gas fee which depending on the demaned of the network, it will be quite discouraging for people who just gets their hands on crptos for small transaction. Many different team have been working on scaling Etheremum capbility with layer 2 soultion zkSync is one of them.

## **Business Activities**
Historical average gas fees

This is a picture shown the historical average gas fees from 2016 to present, as the chart shown strat from early 2020 to mid 2022 the the rising demend of the network such as the heat of decentrilized finance，NFT，etc. push to the gas fees mantain within a very high level. zkSync is one of the project that trying to distribute the pressure of the Ethereum.

### **Company's intended customer**  
* **Ethereum users**

    as the chart shown the ethereum unique addreses since 2016 until present, there are 231 millions users in the network, according to etherscan. It has very healthy growth slope with a increaseing number of daily adresses added. While not all of these addresses represnet unique users, this number provides a sense of the potential user for zkSync
* **dApp developers**

The DeFi ecosystem on Ethereum has grown rapidly over the past years, in the picture shown the data for 2023 May with over $26.91 billions worth of assets locked in Defi protocols, according to DeFiLlama, This growth has created signficant demand for layer 2 scaling solutions like zkSync, which can help dApps handle the increased transaction volume and reduce gas fees
 
* **Businesses and enterprises**

     The potential market size for businesses and enterprises that could benefit from using zkSync is difficult to estimate, as it depends on the specific use cases and industries involved. However, there are a growing number of companies exploring blockchain technology for a variety of purposes, such as supply chain management, digital identity verification, and more.

### **Technology**
zkSync use **Zero Knowledge proofs(ZKPs)** which is a cryptographic technique that allows a prover to demonstrate to a verifier the truth of a statement without revealing any additional information. In zkSync, ZKPs are used to verify all transactions from the Ethereum main chain to the zkSync Layer 2, ensuring transaction security and reducing transaction costs.zkSync uses **Rollup technology**, which bundles multiple transactions into a batch, further improving transaction speed and throughput.

## **Landscape**
zkSync is a Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution, which is a blockchain platform used for decentralized application and cryptocurrecy transactions, but zkSync is not a company, it is developed by Matter Labs, a research and development organization focused on building scalable and secure blockchain infrastructure.

Over the past 5-10 years the blockchain and cryptocurrency domain has experienced significant growth and innovation.Some of the major trends and innovations includes:
* Decentralized Finance(DeFi)- the rise of Defi applications and protocols that allow for decentralized lending, borrowing, trading, and investing without the need from bank
* Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)- the use of blockcahin technology to create unique ditial assets, such as art, music, game character, and collectibles. it can be bought and sold like physical assets
* Smart Contract- the ability to create self-executing contracts with specific conditions
and rules encoded on the blockchanin, and those contracts are transparent, immutable, secure.
* Stablecoins- the development of cryptocurrencies that equal to the value of fiat currencies which help provider better stability and usaability for cryptocurrency users
* Central Bank Digital Currencies(CBDCs)- the exploration and development of the digital version of fiat currencies

## Results
zkSync is a reatively now technology and still underdevelopment, it has not yet had a significant business on the market. As a scaling solution for Ethereum, zkSync aims to increase the transaction throughput and efficiency of the Ethereum Network, which could have a significant impact on the adoption and usability of Ethereum and other blockchanin-based applications

By achieving cheaper, faster, and more secure transaction, zkSync could potentially lead to increased usage of Dapps and greater adoption of cryptocurrencies. This will brings new opportunities for companies operating in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domain.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilise?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
